              ## Bi-Monthly Content Refresh Reminder
              
              It's time to refresh the content on your landing pages to ensure they remain relevant for SEO.
              
              ### Steps:
              1. Clone the repository locally
              2. Run the \`content-refresher.js\` script
              3. Review the GitHub Copilot suggestions for each section
              4. Commit and push the changes
              
              ### Pages to prioritize:
              - High-traffic pages (check analytics)
              - Pages with decreasing search rankings
              - Pages targeting seasonal keywords relevant to the upcoming months
              
              Remember to verify all affiliate links still work after refreshing content!
